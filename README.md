### GoGo's Cool Overlay For Attractive People

I try to have up-to-date, high quality and versioned ebuilds. Ebuilds with a yyyymmdd version number refer to the commit/release date.

## Games

| Package | Game |
| --- | --- |
| games-board/morris | Nine Men's Morris |
| games-puzzle/openblok | Falling Block Game ðŸ˜‰ |

### Games requiring non-free game files (not included)

| Package | Game |

* Catacomb 3D also includes the adventure game series
* Wolfenstein 3D also includes Spear of Destiny and Noahs Arc 3D
* DOOM includes The Ultimate DOOM, DOOM 2, Final DOOM, and various DOOM based games (e.g. Chex Quest) and mods
* RBDOOM-3-BFG is not compatible with the original none BFG release of DOOM 3
* RBDOOM-3-BFG also supports The Ultimate DOOM and DOOM 2 but I would not recommend using it for those games
