# games-emulation/jrommanager-bin

## What is this?

This is the "official" AppImage release of JRomManager from the github of jrommanager.
It's a binary version of games-emulator/jrommanger from the main gentoo repository.

## Why is this?

Gentoo's version sadly is horribly out of date. This is because JRomManger switched to a better build system for Java, gradle.
Sadly tho Gentoo has very poor support for Java to begin with not to mention different build systems.
I don't use Java a lot but from how Java is meant to be used gradle seems to be a good build system.
I mention this since I don't think any of this is a problem with JRomManager or gradle.

Java ebuild are horrible to maintain in the best of times but for unsupported build systems it gets even more difficult.
Stack on top of that, that Java build systems are not meant to be run package by package but rather download and handle every dependency by the system.

So far as I can tell gradle does not support downloading the dependencies in a separate step and thus downloading would have to be enabled for the entire ebuild.
Combine this with Java not really fitting well into the GNU/Linux eco system but rather likes to sit on it's own with all it's dependencies locally.

I tried making this work but without spending a bunch of time implementing gradle support into portage and/or rolling no or our own build system I couldn't make it work.
Frankly this is not worth the effort for me. Not to mention that my inexperience with Java would make this even more effort for me.
